# Vest -- Valorin's Test Suite Artisan Command for Laravel 4.

Vest is a simple package I wrote to allow me to re-use my Laravel 4 test suite
across all of my projects without needing to worry about keeping it in sync.

I've made very little effort to make it massively customizable, since it's
designed by me, for me. If it doesn't work for you, either write your own
or submit a pull request with changes and we can discuss your needs :-)
